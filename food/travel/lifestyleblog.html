<br><b>See How You Don't Have To Start Your Weight Loss Journey Sweaty!</b></center></br>

<center><br>Do you feel like you’ve tried everything to lose weight?
<br>Maybe you’ve even had some success, but struggled to stick to a diet or exercise plan in the long term?</br>
<br>Don’t panic.</br>
<br>Many of the weight loss plans advertised online, in books, and on the covers of magazines simply aren’t sustainable. It’s not you that’s the problem – it’s the diets.</br>
<br>So, what is the best way to lose weight? By removing unhealthy foods, one step at a time.</br>

<br>No more feeling overwhelmed or trapped by a difficult diet or exercise regime – you’ll make real, long-term changes in a way that feels easy and natural.</br>

<br>Start with baby steps. Make your new habit super-easy – something like, ‘Stop drinking fizzy drinks at work.’
Change your environment. Set yourself up for success by filling your fridge with healthy food, sticking up motivational post-it notes and not buying junk food.
Stick your habits together. Try combining habits to make them stick. For example, you could make it a habit write a weekly meal plan while relaxing after your Sunday jog.
Break your large goals down into smaller ones. Your large goal could be to lose weight, while your small goal could be to cut out one unhealthy food this week.
Reward yourself. When you reward yourself for completing a habit, you strengthen it. Try jumping in the air, giving yourself a big smile in the mirror, or reciting positive affirmations each time you make a good food choice.
Avoid too much choice. Create your habits, make them specific, and stick to them. Too much choice overwhelms us, hence the need to avoid fad diets and workout routines.</br></center>

<br><b>How To Decorate A Small Space</b></center>

<center><br>The mirror makes the small dining area feel bigger and brighter. I found it at a thrift store, where it had a gaudy gold frame, but we painted it white to feel more modern.</br>


<br> Behind a white denim curtain, under the stairs, is a huge storage area where we keep winter clothes and Ryan’s movie collection. Some are even VHS! They’re his babies that come with us every time we move.</br>

<br>We hang our clothes on open racks around our bed. Since people can see this rack when they walk in the front door, we decided to put only one color there, so it didn’t look so much like you’re looking into someone’s closet.</br>
<br>We keep things neat because we often work from home. In our old place, we had a spare room that became The Junk Room. </br></center>

<br>We always have soft white bamboo cotton bedding. We make the bed every morning because it adds a sense of calm. Also, this building is definitely not soundproof. Our lease even has a section that talks about the sound. So, we bought an excellent Dohm white noise machine. That helps when one of us wants to sleep in, too.</br>
